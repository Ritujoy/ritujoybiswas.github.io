👨‍🎓 I am a fourth year Ph.D. scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology Jammu, waiting to defend my thesis.

👨‍🔬 I explore the possibilities of restoring speech intelligibility🗣️ in heavily noisy environments💥. 

I also investigate🔍 room acoustics in terms of positioning of single microphone for best human or machine intelligibility and optimal ASR performance.

Am an avid reader of everything that boggles the mind 🤯.

Fascinated by the inter-disciplinary research avenues🧬📡 that build up to solutions of practical problems 💹.
