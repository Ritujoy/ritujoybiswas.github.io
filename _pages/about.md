👨‍🎓 I am a fourth year Ph.D. scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology Jammu, about to defend my thesis.

🔍 I investigate the possibilities of restoring far-end speech🗣️ intelligibility in heavily noisy near-end environments💥.

🔍 I also explore room acoustics in terms of positioning of single microphone🎙️ for best human or machine intelligibility and optimal ASR performance.

🤓 I geek out on everything that boggles the mind 🤯.

😲 I'm fascinated by the inter-disciplinary research avenues🧬📡 that build up to solutions of practical problems 💹.
